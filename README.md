## Versioning and Maintenance

Phlex does not follow semantic versioning (SemVer). Instead, we follow [BreakVer](https://www.taoensso.com/break-versioning).

### Security

When a security issue is brought to our attention, we aim to release patches as soon as possible. We aim to patch with a new `non-breaking` version:

- every `minor` version that was released in the last year;
- the latest `minor` version of the latest two `major` versions, even if over a year old; and
- the `main` branch in GitHub.
